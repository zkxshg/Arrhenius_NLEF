# Arrhenius_NLEF
MATLAB project for material stress prediction using Arrhenius constitutive equation with nonlinear error fitting.

## Introduction
This repository, `Arrhenius_NLEF`, is dedicated to the implementation and exploration of the Arrhenius constitutive equation for material stress prediction, integrating a nonlinear error-fitting approach. Developed using MATLAB, the project aims to provide an accurate and efficient way to predict material behavior under various conditions.

## Features
- Implementation of Arrhenius constitutive equation in MATLAB.
- Nonlinear error fitting to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Dataset processing and analysis for material stress prediction.
- Examples demonstrating the usage and effectiveness of the model.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone this repository to your local machine using:

```
git clone https://github.com/zkxshg/Arrhenius_NLEF.git
```

### Prerequisites
- MATLAB

### Installation
No additional installation is required for this project, as all code is written in MATLAB scripts and functions.

## Usage
The main MATLAB scripts and functions can be run directly in the MATLAB environment. Detailed descriptions and instructions are provided within each file. 

### Example
To run the main prediction model, navigate to the script `main_prediction_script.m` (name this according to your actual script) and execute it in MATLAB.
